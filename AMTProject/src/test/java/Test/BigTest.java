developer creates an account
developer logs in
developer creates 25 pages
developer browses the list of applications (3 pages of 10, 10 and 5 applications)
developer logs out

The tests should include assertions, so that changing the code (e.g. introducing a bug) breaks the code.

The report should describe and document a concrete example (with screenshots).
